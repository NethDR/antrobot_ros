  static_map: false # defines if map can change in time, true if map will not change
  rolling_window: true # keeps the robot in the center of the cost map as it moves throughout the world, dropping obstacle information from the map as the robot moves too far from a given area.
  width: 5.0 # defines the width size of map (in meters)
  height: 5.0 # defines the height size of map (in meters)
  origin_x: -2.5 # defines the x coordinate of the map bottom left corner (in meters). Keeping this value at half of the width and rolling_window=true, will keep the robot in the center of the x-axis of the cost map.
  origin_y: -2.5 # defines the y coordinate of the map bottom left corner (in meters). Keeping this value at half of the height and rolling_window=true, will keep the robot in the center of the y-axis of the cost map.
  resolution: 0.3 # defines size of single map cell (in meters)
  inflation_radius: 0.6 # defines distance to obstacle where cost should be considered, any further from obstacle than this value will be treated as no cost
