  update_frequency: 10.0 # frequency in Hz for the map to be updated
  publish_frequency: 10.0 # frequency in Hz for the map to be published display information
  transform_tolerance: 1.0 # define latency in published transforms (in seconds), if transforms are older than this, planner will stop

  static_map: false # defines if map can change in time, true if map will not change
  rolling_window: true # keeps the robot in the center of the cost map as it moves throughout the world, dropping obstacle information from the map as the robot moves too far from a given area.
  width: 4.0 # defines the width size of map (in meters)
  height: 4.0 # defines the height size of map (in meters)
  origin_x: -2.0 # defines the x coordinate of the map bottom left corner (in meters). Keeping this value at half of the width and rolling_window=true, will keep the robot in the center of the x-axis of the cost map.
  origin_y: -2.0 # defines the y coordinate of the map bottom left corner (in meters). Keeping this value at half of the height and rolling_window=true, will keep the robot in the center of the y-axis of the cost map.
  resolution: 0.01 # defines size of single map cell (in meters)

  inflation_layer:
    inflation_radius: 0.3 # radius in meters to which the map inflates obstacle cost values
    cost_scaling_factor: 10.0 # a scaling factor to apply to cost values during inflation (lower values increase the cost, default = 10)
